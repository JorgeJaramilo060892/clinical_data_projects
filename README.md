# Clinical Data Projects

This repository is dedicated to exploratory analysis, cohort creation, modeling, and visualization of clinical and healthcare-related data. It serves as a sandbox for testing methodologies and pipelines in the context of real-world or simulated clinical datasets.

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

The main objective is to prototype and evaluate machine learning, data wrangling, and clinical data workflows using tools such as:

- SQL 
- Python 
- R 
- Jupyter Notebooks


## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

- Clinical cohort definition.
- EHR or claims data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Machine learning model prototyping (e.g., readmission risk, treatment response).
- Visualization of clinical outcomes and variable distributions.
- Survival analysis and real-world evidence pipelines.

## ðŸ“š Notes

This repository is **not intended for production** and may include experiments, tests, and evolving code. All data used here is either synthetic or anonymized in compliance with privacy standards.
